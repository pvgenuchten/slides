## ISRIC - World Soil Information

- Foundation funded by Dutch Government to maintain a global collection of reference soil samples ([ISIS](https://isis.isric.org))
- Collect and harmonize soil observation data from around the globe ([WOSIS](https://www.isric.org/explore/wosis))
- Globally predict the distribution of soil properties ([Soilgrids](https://www.isric.org/explore/soilgrids))
- Capacity building on soil data management at soil institutes around the globe ([Academy](https://resources.isric.org))
- Participate in [research projects](https://www.isric.org/projects) to innovate the soil sciences

## World Soil Museum

## (meta)data flows at isric

- Museum exhibits and collection management
- Participation in research projects (consortia)
- Global soil products
- Capacity building at national soil insititutes
- Meta studies on availability of works about a topic

## ISRIC & academia

- Foundation embedded in Wageningen University
- Advance the soil sciences through research activities
- Research deliverables are advertised in the academic domain through Citations and DOI

## ISRIC & Open GeoSpatial Consortium

- Spatial distribution of soils explains our interest in spatial standards
- Standardised formats and protocols facilitate long term access to data
- National soil institutes are exchanging soil data through OGC protocols

## ISRIC & Open Source Software

- Tracability of research outputs is facilitated by Open Source Software 
- OSGeo tools are commonly OGC compliant, many innovations at OGC are driven by open source software
- Open formats enable future backwards compatibility for today's datasets
- Sustainability of contributions to Open Source Software 
- Open Source software is often cost effective
- R - GDAL - GRASS - QGIS - Mapserver - pycsw - TerriaJS

## Creation of Soil Maps 

- Soil Property Distribution is predicted by a random forest model on sampling data and covariates (geology, hydrology, satelite imagery)
- Data is organised and produced in folders on a shared file system
- Effective metadata management is crucial for reproducability (and attribution)

## Embedded metadata or Sidecar

- Metadata is automatically embedded in model outputs
- Or a sidecar metadata file is placed alongside a data file (readme.txt)
- Which model to adopt? 
  - Facilitated by the format (MS Excel, GeoTiff, GeoPackage)
  - Common in the community (iso19115, DCAT, Datacite, schema.org)

## A set of tools to work with sidecar files

- [pygeometa](https://pygeometa.org) converts sidecar files between models (mcf, iso, dcat, schema.org)
- [geodatacrawler](https://pypi.org/project/geodatacrawler/) crawls a (network) drive for sidecar files, as input for a catalogue
- [MDME](https://osgeo.github.io/mdme) provides user friendly model driven metadata editing
- [Git](https://catalogue.ejpsoil.eu) as a storage for sidecar files facilitates rich history and remote contributions 

## Data model metadata

- In soil sciences, a lot of observation data is collected
- Observation data is 75% metadata and 25% data (where, what, when, who, how)
- Soil institutes are endorsed to capture metadata as part of dataset metadata
- The data model metadata is important information when harmonizing multiple datasets
- But also to filter datasets by measured property in a catalogue

## CSVW approach for observation data

- in the Soilwise project we're experimenting with users on annotating their observation data 
- CSVW is a standard of W3C to annotate CSV columns so the data can be converted to a knowledge graph
- Average soil scientiests experience the CSVW syntax as complex, we're setting up tools to facilitate the conversion
- Other tools convert the Knowledge Graph data to GeoPackage

## Open challenges

- Limited metadata model in popular repositories such as Dataverse.nl, Zenodo.org, Pangea.de
- How to use sidecar metadata when publishing data in repositories
- Commonly accepted vocabularies to reference observed soil properties and observation procedures
