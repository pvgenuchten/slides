## vocabularies for metadata and data harmonisation, ideas for EGU presentation
 
##Use Cases

- while publishing a dataset of a field campaign, indicate the properties observed, using which procedure, use common ontologies for indicating the properties and procedures
- in data model use the same terms to annotate the columns
- observations are used to create property distribution maps, use the method and property ontologies to indicate the source data for the map
 
## Ontology considerations
- Governance of a common ontology (authoritative, persistence, versioning)
- Usability of an ontology (easy search, assess, reference)
- Interoperability (formats)
- Linkage to same and similar terms (prevent duplication)
 
## Challenges
- We have insitutes (iso, gsp, iuss) but they are quite disconnected from IT practices
- Historically vocabularies were defined as a list with a version number, terms were references by the list version, these days terms are identified individually and can occur in multiple lists
- The skos ontology is nice but tools to work with it are not widely adopted

## Stakeholders

- ISO
- Legal texts
- Academic community

## Role of research projects
- Can not own a vocabulary initiatives, due to the temporary character
- Can proove new approaches work nicely
- Can endorse adoption of approaches

## Current initiatives
- ISLANDR
- Marvic
- Soilwise
- EJP Soil
