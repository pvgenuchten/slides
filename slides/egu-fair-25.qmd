## Use Cases

- While publishing a dataset of a field campaign, indicate the properties observed, using which procedure
- Use common ontologies for indicating the properties and procedures
- In data model metadata use the same terms to annotate the columns
- Observations are used to create property distribution maps, use the method and property ontologies to indicate the source data for the map
 
## Ontology considerations

- Governance of a common ontology (authoritative, persistence, versioning)
- Usability of an ontology (easy search, assess, reference)
- Interoperability (formats)
- Linkage to same and similar terms (prevent duplication)
 
## Challenges

- We have insitutes (iso, gsp, iuss) but they are quite disconnected from IT practices
- Historically vocabularies were defined as a list with a version number, terms were references by the list version, these days terms are identified individually and can occur in multiple lists
- The skos ontology is nice but tools to work with it are not widely adopted

## Stakeholders

- Standardisation bodies (ISO11074:2025)
- Legal texts / EU Soil monitoring law (Gemet/Eurovoc)
- Academic community (IUSS / WRB)
- UN global community (Agrovoc, GSP, Glosolan) 

## Role of research projects

- Can **not** own a vocabulary initiative, due to the temporary character and lack of authority
- Can proove effectiveness of new approaches
- Can set up and endorse strategy on vocabulary development/adoption

## Glossary alignment, a typical project startup activity

- Understand if terms are already listed in other vocabularies
- If so, adopt their definition, reference them as 'sameAs' or 'closeMatch'
- Consider to report back to the common vocabulary if there is not a full match, maybe a narrower term should be defined

## Current initiatives aiming to align efforts on vocabulary development

- ISLANDR
- Marvic
- Soilwise
- EJP Soil
