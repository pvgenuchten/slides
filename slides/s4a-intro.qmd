## Background

- The [AFSIS project](https://isric.org/projects/africa-soil-information-service-afsis) showed the value of a continental map
- It also showed the challenges of map construction
  - availability of observation data 
  - limited description of the data (difficult to harmonize)
  - unclear usage constraints/ownership

## A continental campaign

- Optimized [sampling design](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/documents/downloadPublic?documentIds=080166e5ddc6994a&appId=PPGMS)
- [Standardised Operating Procedures](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/documents/downloadPublic?documentIds=080166e5e535ff43&appId=PPGMS) for Field Survey, Transport and Laboratory
- Analysis by a [single lab](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/documents/downloadPublic?documentIds=080166e50d38a713&appId=PPGMS) 
- Full [data description and clear licence description](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17699297)
- [Dissiminaton of the results](https://africasis.isric.org) for various target audiences

## From observations to maps...

- Link laboratory observations to field sampling locations
- Harmonize data from various campaigns
   - Can observations be compared? conversion required?
   - Field expertise or spatial algorythms to predict distribution (co-variates)
- Add a legend of classes (high-medium-low)
- From the map product, attribute the source data
